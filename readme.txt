== Description ==

Contact Me is an elegant and light AJAX contact form. Activate the plugin and insert simple short code [contactme] into posts/pages. Check out <a href="http://www.icprojects.net/ajax-contact-form.html">working demo</a>.

You also can extend standard shortcode by using attributes "title" and "width". Examples:
[contactme width="350"], [contactme title="This is custom title"], [contactme width="400" title="This form has custom width and title"]

Currently contact form goes with two CSS-driven themes: "Under the Sun" was designed for light WordPress themes, "Deep in the Universe" is well suited for dark themes. Also it has invisible protection against of spam bots (no captcha needed).

Plugin is translation ready. Please help to translate it to different languages.
Special thanks to translators: Javier Briones (spanish, es_ES), Damjan Avsec (slovenian, sl_SI), David (french, fr_FR), Lars Poulsen (danish, dk_DK).
